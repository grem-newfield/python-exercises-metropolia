# 2. Implement a backend service that gets the ICAO code of an airport and then
# returns the name and location of the airport in JSON format. The information
# is fetched from the airport database used on this course. For example, the
# GET request for EFHK would be: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/airport/EFHK`. The
# response must be in the format of: `{"ICAO":"EFHK", "Name":"Helsinki-Vantaa
# Airport", "Location":"Helsinki"}`.
